# Sentiment Analysis For Restauarent Reviews
Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis for Restaurant Reviews project! This project aims to analyze the sentiment of restaurant reviews to help businesses understand customer opinions and feedback. The application uses natural language processing techniques to categorize reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, providing valuable insights for restaurant owners and managers.

Before we dive deep into this project, I would like to mention that this project was made during my internship with IBM through Eduskills AICTE.
It is according to me the simplest form of Sentiment Analysis representation.

You can try this sentiment analysis for any field as long as you have the suitable and sufficient dataset required for your project.
